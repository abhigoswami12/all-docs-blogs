## Gizmo App

Noone uses an app not updating their data. That is exactly what we are doing in our app. Now using lifecycle we are going to get the article informations from NewsAPI.

**Country will be India (in) and language will English (en)**

Go through the documentation to understand how to use the api.

- [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/)

Use the above api and update the gizmo app to UI like given below.

- In header you should have news sources to filter and the first sources will 'all'
- Sidebar will have the data from top headlines.
- Main body will have one post to as feature post
- Other stories will have all the other stories.
- When you click on header sources it should only show post from that specific source.

#### BONUS
