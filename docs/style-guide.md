All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.

Follow these recommendations:

- Don't mix spaces and tabs.
- Set editor's indent size to two characters. Means now one tab will be two spaces.

Follow good practices from [Link](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/)

In short follow this awesome cheatsheet. ![Coding Style](/img/value/coding-style.png)
